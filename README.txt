Test Runner in Python.

Guidelines::

TestCases and corresponding Fixtures should be in the same .py file or module
TestCases should end in Tests eg "AssertTests"
The corresponding Fixtures should end in "Fixtures" eg  "AssertFixture"

ToDo ::

Make the above configurable
Make the assertion configurable ie  Soft or Hard
Port all the assert functionalities
